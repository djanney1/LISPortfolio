### My MLIS Portfolio

The website https://djanney1.github.io/LISPortfolio testifies to my ability to utilize R Studio, the R and Quarto programming languages, and Google. I went into building this portfolio knowing I wanted to use GitHub as a host after learning about it in LIS 5937 (R Programming). I am not an expert programmer by any means, but I am able to resolve issues with Google searches. I am proud of what I have created here.

This portfolio highlights my work from the University of South Florida's MLIS program, my personal artwork, and extracurricular certificates allocated from webinars.

*This repo was initially generated from a Quarto template available here: https://github.com/jtr13/website-template.*
