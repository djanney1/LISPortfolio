Students analyze, organize and describe various formats of information objects.\nLIS 6726 - Metadata\nDanielle Janney Collection\nThe Danielle Janney Collection is one part of a greater group project focused on cataloging natural history objects from Florida. The project is hosted on Omeka and uses Dublin Core to describe the metadata of the selected resources. \nLIS 6726 - Metadata\nUnderstanding Metadata\n\nMetadata in a highly digitized world is transforming the world’s access to information. Search engines at personal and institutional levels relay thousands of query results in less than a second. Interoperability of metadata schema within collections face the challenge of effective crosswalks while preparing for the next phase of Linked Data and entity relationship models. Metadata is not a new concept, but how it is interacted with is breaking ground to unite the information landscape.\n\nRead full essay\n\n\n\nIII.b.

    "text": "This website exemplifies my strengths as an Master of Library and Information Science student with a Bachelor of Fine Art background. I began my MLIS in the Fall of 2020. The five years preceding this event had me employed in the food service industry; this time gave me experience with listening, fulfilling needs, troubleshooting technology (third-party delivery tablets), and asking for support in kitchens–if you know, you know. Nothing is harder than a just-post-COVID-19 kitchen with multiple delivery tablets and ringing phones on a two-man shift. By early 2022, I was and am working as a public library assistant.\n\n\nPursuing my MLIS degree and working in a library has granted me the experience to exchange knowledge between both environments. I am better able to appreciate the practical investments, technological challenges, human errors, and overall goodness a library does for its community. It is my goal to find my place in an art-based library."

It is proposed the Clearwater Countryside branch pilots the display of quick-response (QR) code sheets featuring the most popular handouts to increase information accessibility, general outreach, and technological practices. The following document outlines a method of creating QR code sheets in Canva, includes a budget and timeline, and discusses additional uses for QR codes in the library.\n\nRead full proposal\n\nSummer Cinema and Public Library Movie Licensing\nThe Clearwater Countryside library patrons wanted to bring back movies on Sundays after the COVID-19 hiatus and my branch manager suggested a library assistant could sit in on them (since the librarians tended to be shorter staffed), so I volunteered to research and put together a seasonal trial program.\n\nI was instructed to choose from movies available on Swank’s Public Libraries Movie Licensing website and I also put together a flyer on Canva to share on social media (see above image).\nAfter solidifying the films and dates for my program at work, I was assigned (in Collection Development & Maintenance) with creating a handout for a library staff’s copyright professional development, so I focused on film.\nView Copyright Professional Development handout\n\nWebinars\nI have completed over 20 webinars presented by Florida Library Webinars since the beginning of my library career in February 2022.
