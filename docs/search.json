Search engines at personal and institutional levels relay thousands of query results in less than a second. Interoperability of metadata schema within collections face the challenge of effective crosswalks while preparing for the next phase of Linked Data and entity relationship models. Metadata is not a new concept, but how it is interacted with is breaking ground to unite the information landscape.\n\n\nI learned the R programming language (LIS 5937), becoming familiar with RStudio and GitHub. I utilized a sample of food delivery data to ultimately create an R package and Markdown to compare days of the week, order totals, and tips received (sampled below).\n\nI also kept a blog of assignments throughout the semester to track process and progress.

    "text": "My career as an MLIS student began while working in the food service industry in the fall of 2020. By February of 2022, I found work in a public library as a part-time library assistant and a full-time position followed nine months later. My experience in restaurants has prepared me well for the library setting: I am capable of listening, fulfilling needs, understanding difficulties with following directions, troubleshooting technology, and I do not hesitate to ask for support.\n\n\nPursuing my degree and working in a library has granted me the experience to exchange knowledge between both environments. I am better able to appreciate the practical investments, technological challenges, human errors, and overall goodness a library does for its community."

It is proposed the Clearwater Countryside branch pilots the display of quick-response (QR) code sheets featuring the most popular handouts to increase information accessibility, general outreach, and technological practices. The following document outlines a method of creating QR code sheets in Canva, includes a budget and timeline, and discusses additional uses for QR codes in the library.\n\nRead full proposal\n\nSummer Cinema and Public Library Movie Licensing\nThe Clearwater Countryside library patrons wanted to bring back movies on Sundays after the COVID-19 hiatus and my branch manager suggested a library assistant could sit in on them (since the librarians tended to be shorter staffed), so I volunteered to research and put together a seasonal trial program.\n\nI was instructed to choose from movies available on Swank’s Public Libraries Movie Licensing website and I also put together a flyer on Canva to share on social media (see above image).\nAfter solidifying the films and dates for my program at work, I was assigned (in Collection Development & Maintenance) with creating a handout for a library staff’s copyright professional development, so I focused on film.\nView Copyright Professional Development handout\n\nWebinars\nI have completed over 20 webinars presented by Florida Library Webinars since the beginning of my library career in February 2022.
