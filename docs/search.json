Search engines at personal and institutional levels relay thousands of query results in less than a second. Interoperability of metadata schema within collections face the challenge of effective crosswalks while preparing for the next phase of Linked Data and entity relationship models. Metadata is not a new concept, but how it is interacted with is breaking ground to unite the information landscape.\n\n\nI learned the R programming language (LIS 5937), becoming familiar with RStudio and GitHub. I utilized a sample of food delivery data to ultimately create an R package and Markdown to compare days of the week, order totals, and tips received (sampled below).\n\nI also kept a blog of assignments throughout the semester to track process and progress.\nThis portfolio website was created in RStudio and is hosted on GitHub."

    "text": "My career as an MLIS student began while working in the food service industry in the fall of 2020. By February of 2022, I found work in a public library as a part-time library assistant and a full-time position followed nine months later. My experience in restaurants prepared me well for the library setting: I am capable of listening and fulfilling needs, understanding difficulties with technology, and I do not hesitate to ask for support.\n\n\nPursuing my degree and working in a library has granted me the experience to exchange knowledge between both environments. I am better able to acknowledge and appreciate the technological investments and challenges a public library may encounter on short notice, and the true social good that a library brings to its community."
