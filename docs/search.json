Students will describe applications of quantitative and qualitative research methodologies in library and information science.\nLIS 6271 - A Proposed Study on the Effects of Prioritizing Diverse Material in a Public Library’s Book Displays\nIn this group project, with a literature review focused on increasing circulation of materials based on high-traffic locations in a library and applying a mixed-methods approach to gathering data, our group proposed displaying diverse materials in a public library and collecting survey and interview responses from patrons to better understand the factors of their choices.\nLIS 6511 - The Flushing Neighborhood Libraries in the Queens, NY\nI referred to the Queens Public Library for my assignments that utilized (real and fabricated) qualitative and quantitative data to assess Flushing community needs, build a more balanced collection, and develop a collection policy.\n\nCommunity Needs Assessment\nBuilding a Balanced Collection\nCollection Development Policy\n\n\n\n\nIV.b. Students will identify opportunities for research and develop plans for research in applied settings in library and information science.\nLIS 5937 - Knowledge Sharing Among Peers\nPeer knowledge sharing is an underdeveloped concept in knowledge management research that I have since applied with new, immediate coworkers. I believe it has put me in a trusted position and has made the workspace better for it. Without evidence, though, I am interested in how it could be better managed.\nLIS 6409 - Leadership in Libraries: Theories and Competencies\nIn my research of library leadership, I learned it is not dissimilar from other organizational leadership positions, yet it is unique to those who conduct research about it. I see myself as a leader, someone who is supportive and reliable. With my coworkers (mostly other library assistants), I analyze how they approach their role, relationships with others, and I gain an understanding of them; I use my understandings to minimize conflict, sympathize, and overcome collective challenges. Personalities are bound to clash at some point and it is this that leads me into research of conflict management, into being an information professional above anything else."

    "text": "I began the Masters in Library and Information Science program at the University of South Florida in the Fall of 2020 while working mostly as a restaurant delivery driver. By working in the food service industry, I learned I enjoyed providing a service to people in an intimate way, even if it was just handing them pizza at their door. The environment became exhausting, however, so instead of just switching to another pizza place, I researched potential career paths and fixated on library and information science. I did not know all library work could entail, but by early 2022 in the midst of my studies, I was hired as a public library assistant and would soon discover.\nSince then, I have been able to apply my knowledge from my MLIS classes and vice versa. I now have years of experience working with an integrated library system, circulation and library policies and procedures, technology assistance, readers advisory, and collection maintenance.\nCurrently in my position, I am in charge of cataloging and maintaining the magazine collection, overseeing missing items (i.e. missing discs), “alien” items, and managing and inventorying the Library of Things (board games, tools, small tech). I have also undertook projects of collection inventory; so far, I have inventoried my library’s adult fiction, large print, paperback, and adult non-fiction sections. I also lead the disc cleaning of audiovisual items–though it’s not official, I have created a short how-to page and am consulted for guidance when using the disc cleaning machine. It is with these responsibilities that I have proven myself to be a token employee and respected coworker.\nIt is my intent to be a public librarian and eventually find employment with an art-based institution."
