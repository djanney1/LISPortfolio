From my essay, [Understanding Metadata](img/understanding_metadata.pdf){target="_blank"}:

> Metadata in a highly digitized world is transforming the world's access to information. Search engines at personal and institutional levels relay thousands of query results in less than a second. Interoperability of metadata schema within collections face the challenge of effective crosswalks while preparing for the next phase of Linked Data and entity relationship models. Metadata is not a new concept, but how it is interacted with is breaking ground to unite the information landscape.
