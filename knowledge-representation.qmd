**LIS 5937 - [R Programming](https://rpubs.com/djanney1/deliverystats){target="_blank"}**

I learned the R programming language, becoming familiar with RStudio and GitHub, to develop a package and a visual document of my collected data. A [blog](https://www.tumblr.com/d-janney){target="_blank"} kept during the class shows other visual representations.

This portfolio website was developed in RStudio and is hosted on GitHub.
