**Project Proposal: QR Codes in Clearwater Countryside Library**

> The Clearwater Public Library System primarily depends on print materials to share information regarding library events, services, and policies, and overlooks the option of paperless dissemination of information. It is proposed the Clearwater Countryside branch pilots the display of quick-response (QR) code sheets featuring the most popular handouts to increase information accessibility, general outreach, and technological practices. The following document outlines a method of creating QR code sheets in Canva, includes a budget and timeline, and discusses additional uses for QR codes in the library.

**Summer Cinema and Public Library Movie Licensing**

The Clearwater Countryside library patrons wanted to bring back movies on Sundays after the COVID-19 hiatus and my branch manager suggested a library assistant could sit in on them (since the librarians tended to be shorter staffed), so I volunteered to research and put together a seasonal trial program.

I was instructed to choose from movies available on [Swank's Public Libraries Movie Licensing website](https://www.swank.com/public-libraries/copyright/) and I also put together a flyer on Canva to share on social media (see above image).

After solidifying the films and dates for my program at work, I was assigned (in Collection Development & Maintenance) with creating a handout for a library staff's copyright professional development, so I focused on film.
