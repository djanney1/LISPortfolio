**Clearwater Countryside Library - [Summer Cinema](img/summer_cinema1.jpg){target="_blank"} and [Webinars](certificates.qmd){target="_blank"}**

I engaged with the community when I volunteered to manage and oversee a movie series over the summer. I collaborated with my branch manager to work out the dates, selected an array of new movies from [Swank's Public Libraries Movie Licensing website](https://www.swank.com/public-libraries/copyright/){target="_blank"}, and put together a promotional post to share on social media.

As well, I have participated in further professional development by completing dozens of webinars since my employment in 2022.

### I.d. Students demonstrate leadership skills and innovation in a diverse and global environment.
