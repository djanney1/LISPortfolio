**Project Proposal: QR Codes in Clearwater Countryside Library**

> The Clearwater Public Library System primarily depends on print materials to share information regarding library events, services, and policies, and overlooks the option of paperless dissemination of information. It is proposed the Clearwater Countryside branch pilots the display of quick-response (QR) code sheets featuring the most popular handouts to increase information accessibility, general outreach, and technological practices. The following document outlines a method of creating QR code sheets in Canva, includes a budget and timeline, and discusses additional uses for QR codes in the library.

Summer Cinema**

The Clearwater Countryside library patrons wanted to bring back movies on Sundays after the COVID-19 hiatus and my branch manager suggested a library assistant could show them, so I volunteered. I was instructed to choose from movies from [Swank's Public Libraries Movie Licensing website](https://www.swank.com/public-libraries/copyright/){target="_blank"}, we worked out a schedule, and I put together a promotional post on Canva to share on social media.
