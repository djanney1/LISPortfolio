I began the Masters in Library and Information Science program at the University of South Florida in the Fall of 2020 while working mostly as a restaurant delivery driver. By working in the food service industry, I learned I enjoyed providing a service to people in an intimate way, even if it was just handing them pizza at their door. The environment became exhausting, however, so instead of just switching to another pizza place, I researched potential career paths and fixated on library and information science. I did not know all library work could entail, but by early 2022 in the midst of my studies, I was hired as a public library assistant and would soon discover.

Since then, I have been able to apply my knowledge from my MLIS classes and vice versa. I now have years of experience working with an integrated library system, circulation and library policies and procedures, technology assistance, readers advisory, and collection maintenance.

Currently in my position, I am in charge of cataloging and maintaining the magazine collection, overseeing missing items (i.e. missing discs), "alien" items, and managing and inventorying the Library of Things (board games, tools, small tech). I have also undertook projects of collection inventory; so far, I have inventoried my library's adult fiction, large print, paperback, and non-fiction sections. I am trusted by my supervisor to oversee the training and success of newly hired library assistants in the absence of more senior employees; in these situations I apply learned leadership skills to boost confidence and instill pride in the learning process. It is with these responsibilities that I have proven myself to be an successful, emerging information professional.

It is my intent to transition into a public librarian role and eventually find employment with an art-based institution.
