######### This website exemplifies my strengths as an Master of Library and Information Science student with a Bachelor of Fine Art background. I began my MLIS in the Fall of 2020. The five years preceding this event had me employed in the food service industry; this time gave me experience with listening, fulfilling needs, troubleshooting technology (third-party delivery tablets), and asking for support in kitchens--if you know, you know. Nothing is harder than a just-post-COVID-19 kitchen with multiple delivery tablets and ringing phones on a two-man shift. By early 2022, I was and am working as a public library assistant. 

######### Pursuing my MLIS degree and working in a library has granted me the experience to exchange knowledge between both environments. I am better able to appreciate the practical investments, technological challenges, human errors, and overall goodness a library does for its community. It is my goal to find my place in an art-based library.
