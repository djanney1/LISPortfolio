######### I began the MLIS program in the Fall of 2020 while working mostly as a restaurant delivery driver. By working in the food service industry, I learned I enjoyed providing a service to people in an intimate way, even if it was just handing them pizza at their door. The environment became exhausting, however, so instead of just switching to another pizza joint, I brainstormed potential career paths and landed on librarianship. By early 2022, I found new employment as a public library assistant. With my BFA in Studio Art, I aim to find a career in an art-based institution.

######### This website exemplifies my work as an Master of Library and Information Science student and information professional.
