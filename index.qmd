######### My career as an MLIS student began while working in the food service industry in the fall of 2020. By February of 2022, I found work in a public library as a part-time library assistant and a full-time position followed nine months later. My experience in restaurants prepared me well for the library setting: I am capable of listening and fulfilling needs, understanding difficulties with technology, and I do not hesitate to ask for support.

######### Pursuing my degree and working in a library has granted me the experience to exchange knowledge between both environments. I am better able to acknowledge and appreciate the technological investments and challenges a public library may encounter on short notice, and the true social good that a library brings to its community.
