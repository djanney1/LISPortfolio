######### My career as an MLIS student began while working in the food service industry in the fall of 2020. By February of 2022, I found work in a public library as a part-time library assistant and a full-time position followed nine months later. My experience in restaurants has prepared me well for the library setting: I am capable of listening, fulfilling needs, understanding difficulties with following directions, troubleshooting technology, and I do not hesitate to ask for support.

######### Pursuing my degree and working in a library has granted me the experience to exchange knowledge between both environments. I am better able to appreciate the practical investments, technological challenges, human errors, and overall goodness a library does for its community.
