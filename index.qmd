## About Me
######### My career as an MLIS student began while working in the food service industry in the fall of 2020. By February of 2022, I found work in a public library as a part-time library assistant and a full-time position followed nine months later. My experience in restaurants prepared me well for managing interactions within the library setting: I am capable of listening and fulfilling needs, understanding difficulties with technologies, and I do not hesitate to ask for support.
######### As much as I think I may know, I realize there is always more to learn and find comfort in learning with those that ask for help.
