title: "Statement of Integrity"
---

-   All artifacts, reflections, narratives, and examples are mine alone (except where indicated as a group or team project), and has been prepared solely by me.
-   I am protecting the privacy of the contents of my e-Portfolio by password protecting it, submitting it through Canvas, or by sharing the URL only with my e-portfolio advisor.
-   Any publicly accessible pages have been deliberately designed and approved by me and by my advisor so that they may be used for potential job search or other public access to my professional portfolio or web page.
-   Before making my e-portfolio public I will respect the privacy of others by information that could lead to the identity of individuals (team members in group projects, internship supervisors, interviewees, etc.) and institutions.
